# Custom Languages

Lotus includes built-in runners for common interpreted, compiled, systems, and proof-oriented languages. Additional local languages can be added from the settings tab under **Custom Languages**.

A custom language configuration defines:
- **Name**
- **Aliases** (comma-separated)
- **Executable**
- **Arguments** (e.g., `{file}`)
- **Source file extension**
- **Optional preprocessor stages**
- **Optional extractor executable**
- **Optional extractor arguments** (e.g., `{request}`)

### Example Configuration

```text
name: shellcustom
aliases: shx
executable: /bin/sh
args: {file}
extension: .sh
```

With this configured, a normal fenced block can run using that alias:

````markdown
```shx
echo hello
```
````

---

## Preprocessor Stages

Custom languages can define one or more named preprocessor stages. Lotus runs these stages before selecting the final runner. Each stage receives a stable input file and planned output file under:

```text
.lotus/preprocess/<note-path>/block-<ordinal>-<source-language>/
```

The path is stable for the note, block ordinal, and source fence language, so external tools can inspect or reuse intermediate files while a block is edited.

Each stage can return transformed source and optionally change the language and file extension for the next stage or final runner. This lets a source fence such as `toy` preprocess into `c`, `python`, or another custom language with its own execution command.

### Stage Configuration

```text
name: lower-to-c
executable: toy-lower
args: {request}
language: c
extension: .c
```

`language` and `extension` are defaults for the stage output. The stage command can override them in its JSON response.

Supported argument placeholders:

- `{request}`: JSON request file.
- `{input}`, `{source}`, or `{file}`: Current stage input file.
- `{output}`: Planned output file for this stage.
- `{artifactDir}`: Stable directory containing all stage files.
- `{language}` / `{extension}`: Current input language and extension.
- `{outputLanguage}` / `{outputExtension}`: Configured output language and extension.
- `{sourceLanguage}` / `{alias}`: Original fence language and alias.
- `{note}` / `{blockId}`: Note path and Lotus block id.
- `{stage}` / `{stageName}`: 1-based stage number and stage name.

### Request JSON Shape

```json
{
  "language": "toy",
  "outputLanguage": "c",
  "extension": ".toy",
  "outputExtension": ".c",
  "sourceLanguage": "toy",
  "languageAlias": "toy",
  "notePath": "notes/demo.md",
  "blockId": "abc123",
  "ordinal": 1,
  "stage": 1,
  "stageName": "lower-to-c",
  "inputFile": ".lotus/preprocess/notes-demo.md/block-1-toy/stage-00-input.toy",
  "outputFile": ".lotus/preprocess/notes-demo.md/block-1-toy/stage-01-lower-to-c.c",
  "artifactDirectory": ".lotus/preprocess/notes-demo.md/block-1-toy"
}
```

### Stage Output

A preprocessor can write source to `stdout` as plain text. It can also print JSON:

```json
{
  "description": "toy lowered to c",
  "language": "c",
  "extension": ".c",
  "content": "int main(void) { return 0; }"
}
```

Alternatively, it can write the output file path from the request and print no `stdout`, or return:

```json
{
  "outputFile": ".lotus/preprocess/notes-demo.md/block-1-toy/stage-01-lower-to-c.c",
  "language": "c",
  "extension": ".c"
}
```

Returned `outputFile` paths must stay inside `artifactDirectory`.

Lotus records each stage in the run output so the intermediate source and file path can be inspected.

## Runnable Partial Source Extraction

Custom languages can support runnable partial source extraction. Each custom language choose one of the following strategies:
1. **Extractor Command**: Use when the language has its own parser, compiler API, or LSP.
2. **Transpile to C**: Use when the language lowers to C and can provide a symbol map.

### Extractor Command Contract

Lotus writes a JSON request file and passes its path to the configured command. The command must print JSON to `stdout`.

#### Request JSON Shape

```json
{
  "language": "toy",
  "filePath": "src/example.toy",
  "symbolName": "main",
  "lineStart": null,
  "lineEnd": null,
  "traceDependencies": true,
  "sourceFile": "/tmp/lotus-extract/source.txt",
  "harnessFile": "/tmp/lotus-extract/harness.txt"
}
```

#### Supported Argument Placeholders

- `{request}`
- `{source}` or `{file}`
- `{harness}`
- `{symbol}`
- `{lineStart}`
- `{lineEnd}`
- `{deps}`
- `{language}`

#### Response JSON Shape

The extractor can return a complete runnable source:

```json
{
  "description": "src/example.toy#main",
  "content": "..."
}
```

Or it can return structured parts:

```json
{
  "imports": ["..."],
  "dependencies": ["..."],
  "selected": "..."
}
```

### Transpile to C Strategy

The transpile to C strategy returns generated C or C++ and a symbol map:

```json
{
  "language": "c",
  "generatedSource": "int toy_score_impl(int x) { return x + 1; }",
  "symbols": {
    "score": "toy_score_impl"
  },
  "harness": "int main(void) { return toy_score_impl(1); }"
}
```

- `language`: Must be `c` or `cpp`.
- `symbols`: Maps source language names to generated C/C++ names.
- `harness`: (Optional) Useful when the note harness is written in the source language instead of generated C.

## Fallback Behavior

If no extractor is configured for a custom language, lotus falls back to generic line extraction and simple symbol slicing.
